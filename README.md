# Welcome to git-writers
> Open source writing for the brave-hearted.

Versioning can be used as a way to keep track of different variations and iterations of the stories that you write.
We can use Markdown (file_name.md) to create different files.  
You can read more about Markdown here: [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## How-to

You need a basic understanding of Git and GitHub to be able to contribute to this project.
The basic idea is to *fork this project*, *add your own edits, updates, suggestions*, and then create a *pull request* to allow us to *merge* the changes.

## The point of all this?
We realize that not all writers are programmers and vice-versa, however, GitHub is not very complicated to learn and with enough practice and with the intuitive UI, a writer with no connection to the world of coding can become an integral part of this GitHub repository.  
GitHub allows for *version control* and *forking*. This means that you can basically create as many unique versions of a story as possible or contribute to an existing story.   
Maybe you're good at character development, or you enjoy writing vivid descriptions. Whatever your forte, you will get to display it and maybe even get it added into the mainline.

## The story?
We intend for this repository to contain many different stories, novels and chapters from all over the world. feel free to add your own or contribute to an ongoing story!
